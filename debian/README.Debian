wormhole for Debian
=================

This package contains the 'wormhole' network utility.

The 'wormhole' tool provides an ability to forward a private TCP service from
the remote host to the local interface or forward local TCP service to the remote side
via an UDP tunnel with optional ability to obfuscate the tunnel by a pre-shared key.
